<b>Perfect — if you already have an SSH key, there’s no need to generate a new one. You just need to make sure your VM knows about it and Git/VS Code can use it. Here’s the **updated SSH step** in the guide:</b>

---

### **8. Git / GitHub setup (using an existing SSH key)**

1. **Copy your existing SSH key to the VM**

   * If your key is on another machine:

```bash
# Replace <path-to-existing-key> with your private key location
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
scp user@othermachine:<path-to-existing-key> ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
scp user@othermachine:<path-to-existing-key>.pub ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

* Or just paste your key manually into `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.

2. **Ensure SSH agent is running and add your key**

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

3. **Test connection to GitHub**

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

* Should say something like: `Hi username! You've successfully authenticated.`

4. **Use SSH URLs for repositories in VS Code**

* Example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
```

* VS Code extensions and Git integration will now automatically use your existing key — no prompts.

---

✅ **TL;DR:**

* Instead of generating a new key, copy your existing private/public key to `~/.ssh/` in the VM, set proper permissions, add it to the SSH agent, and test GitHub connection.

This replaces the previous “generate new SSH key” step in the guide.

If you want, I can **rewrite the full guide with this SSH update incorporated**, so it’s ready to copy-paste for your VM setup.

Do you want me to do that?

<h2>If you don't know where your key is:</h2>

Perfect — since the VM is running **on your laptop**, and your SSH key is already on GitHub, this is actually pretty straightforward. You basically just need to **make the VM aware of your existing key** and ensure it works with Git/VS Code. Later, you can reuse the same key for a dual boot. Here’s how to do it cleanly:

---

## **1. Copy the SSH key from your laptop to the VM**

Assuming the VM is running on your laptop, you can copy the key **directly from your host OS** into the VM:

1. Open a terminal on your **host laptop** where the key exists.
2. Copy the key files to the VM using the VM’s shared folder (VirtualBox / VMware) **or** by manual copy-paste:

**Option A: Using shared folder**

* Set up a shared folder between your host and VM (e.g., `/home/djblackberry4/hostkeys`).
* Copy the key files to that folder from your host.
* Then move them to your SSH folder in the VM:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
mv /home/djblackberry4/hostkeys/id_ed25519* ~/.ssh/
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

**Option B: Manual copy-paste**

* Open the key on your laptop:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

* Copy the content, then paste into new files in your VM:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/id_ed25519      # Paste private key
nano ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  # Paste public key
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

---

## **2. Add key to SSH agent in the VM**

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

* Now the VM can use the key for Git/VS Code without prompting for a password.

---

## **3. Test GitHub connection from the VM**

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

* Should respond:

```
Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated.
```

---

## **4. Reusing the same key for dual boot**

* When you set up Linux on dual boot later:

  1. Copy the same private/public key to `~/.ssh/` on the new installation.
  2. Run `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or add it to `~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc`.
  3. Test `ssh -T git@github.com` — it will work instantly.

**Tip:** You only ever need **one key pair** per GitHub account, you can safely reuse it across all your Linux installations.

---

✅ **Summary TL;DR**

* Copy your existing SSH key to `~/.ssh/` in the VM.
* Set correct permissions (`600` private, `644` public).
* Add it to the SSH agent (`ssh-add`).
* Test connection with `ssh -T git@github.com`.
* Later, copy the same key to your dual-boot Linux — no need to generate a new one.

If you want, I can **rewrite your full “ready-to-code Linux VM setup guide”** including **this SSH integration** so it’s perfectly ready for both VM and dual boot.

Do you want me to do that?
