This is the first version of a style guide for the linked resources in this repo.
The followed structure should be prefered for improved clarity:
<br />
```
[name of the resource](little max. 3 word description): 
[longer one sentence description] - 
[anchor tag with "Link" as the link text, auto check for non active links will add status (date and if it's active) to the link text]
```
