# Contributions
## What to consider
We are always happy about contributions to our repo but there are a few things that need to be considered first.
A couple of these are:
1. Please check other resources first as we don't want unnecessary duplicates.
2. Check out our wanted topic list where we post each topic that is in need for more resources.
3. Please follow our style guidelines when making a contribution proposal
4. Be ready to answer clarifying questions to your resource addition
